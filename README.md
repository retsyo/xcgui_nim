# xcgui_nim
xcgui binding for nimlang

Please note, 
1. the DLL can be download from www.xcgui.com, however it is in Chinese, so I put the DLL and C header file here too. If you, the guys from www.xcgui.com, think this offends the copyright, please let me know to remove them

2. only the 32bits version xcgui.dll is free for use. The 64bits DLL and the GUI layout designer are commercial products.

3. you can only use 32bits nim compiler and GCC/tcc(?) to compile

4. there are bugs. Please help me to fix them
